                    <p>Question: Why is the text color on the FAQ page a different color then the 
                        other pages on the site?</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: There is no white lettering on the last page and this section needed
                        to have attention drawn to it.  Hence the red. :)

                    <p>Question: How long did it take you to develop and debug this site?</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: The better part of 2 days.  I would estimate about 20 hours from 
                        the first line of code to the last page completed.

                    <br>
                    <p>Question: What did you do for work in the time you were unemployed after 
                        working for Elite Metro Corp?
                    </p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: I became a stay at home Dad.  Mom went to work while I took care 
                        of the kiddo.  Some say this is a full time job and those people would 
                        be right.  Single parents and stay at home parents definitely have my 
                        respect.

                    <p>Question: What coding languages are you fluent with?
                    </p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: At this time, I am proficient with HTML/CSS, JS, and some React. 
                        I am currently self studying and growing to learn new languages.

                    <p>Question: What is your availability for interviewing and your availability 
                        if hired?
                    </p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: At this time, I have an open availability for interviewing.  As for 
                        working... I am available 7 days a week/ on any shift.  My prefered days off 
                        are currently Tuesday and Wednesday.

                    <br>
                    <p>Question: What is the best way to contact you?
                    </p><br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Answer: The best way to reach me is via phone/text.  I spend a lot of time working 
                        on web development and expanding my skill set.  My phone is by my side on the desk. 
                        My email is not always open and does not always notify me. I do, however, 
                        check it several times a day.
